# Personal Notes

@actions toolkit provides many javascript packages like @actions/core, @actions/github-script etc. Install @actions/github-script using npm:

The info about a GitHub action is in a JSON object called event-payload,made available the GitHub Actions runtime and represents the event that triggered the workflow. The environment-variable $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH points to the json file that contains every information about the workflow.

When using javascript, we can skip reading and parsing the $GITHUB_EVENT_PATH json file and instead use convinient functions in the github-script package that contains many useful scripts that can be used as APIs for GitHub. 

@actions/github-script is not one of the dependencies of the action. See package.json. You'll see that @actions/core is listed as a dependency, but @actions/github-script is not. So let's add a reference to it using
npm install --save @actions/github-script
Edit: [July 2020] github-script is not registered in npm registry. Use the deprecated @actions/github package instead.

You can now see that package.json has two dependencies - @actions/core and @actions/github



**default notes from the template**

# Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript

Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a JavaScript action.:rocket:

This template includes compilication support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.  

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction.  See the [Hello World JavaScript Action](https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action)

## Create an action from this template

Click the `Use this Template` and provide the new repo details for your action

## Code in Master

Install the dependencies  
```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution
```bash
$ npm run build && npm run pack
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  
```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
  ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ✓ test runs (95ms)

...
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try { 
      ...
  } 
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder. 

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:
```bash
$ npm run pack
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Your action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml)])

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/javascript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
